# GiphyProject

## Overview 

* This project uses the Giphy API in conjunction with Javascript and jQuery to create a dynamic website that populates with gifs of your choice. 

* Click on a pre-set button and see 10 non-animated gifs from the Giphy API. Click on an image to animate it, and click again to stop the animation. 

* Under each image, is its rating.

* The user may enter a search term and create another button on the page. Each button will change the content of the gifs.
